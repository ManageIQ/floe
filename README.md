## Overview

Floe is a runner for [Amazon States Language](https://states-language.net/) workflows with support for Docker resources and running on Docker, Podman, or Kubernetes.

## Installation

Install the gem and add to the application's Gemfile by executing:

    $ bundle add floe

If bundler is not being used to manage dependencies, install the gem by executing:

    $ gem install floe

## Usage

Floe can be run as a command-line utility or as a ruby class.

### Command Line

```
bundle exec ruby exe/floe --workflow examples/workflow.asl --inputs='{"foo": 1}'
```

By default Floe will use `docker` to run `docker://` type resources, but `podman` and `kubernetes` are also supported runners.
A different runner can be specified with the `--docker-runner` option:

```
bundle exec ruby exe/floe --workflow examples/workflow.asl --inputs='{"foo": 1}' --docker-runner podman
bundle exec ruby exe/floe --workflow examples/workflow.asl --inputs='{"foo": 1}' --docker-runner kubernetes --docker-runner-options namespace=default server=https://k8s.example.com:6443 token=my-token
```

If your workflow has `Credentials` you can provide a payload that will help resolve those credentials references at runtime.

For example if your workflow had the following Credentials field with a JSON Path property:
```json
"Credentials": {
  "RoleArn.$": "$.roleArn"
}
```

You can provide that at runtime via the `--credentials` parameter:

```
bundle exec ruby exe/floe --workflow my-workflow.asl --credentials='{"roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/LambdaRole"}'
```

Or if you are running the floe command programmatically you can securely provide the credentials via a stdin pipe via `--credentials=-`:
```
echo '{"roleArn": "arn:aws:iam::111122223333:role/LambdaRole"}' | bundle exec ruby exe/floe --workflow my-workflow.asl --credentials -
```

Or you can pass a file path with the `--credentials-file` parameter:
```
bundle exec ruby exe/floe --workflow my-workflow.asl --credentials-file /tmp/20231218-80537-kj494t
```

If you need to set a credential at runtime you can do that by using the `"ResultPath": "$$.Credentials"` directive, for example to user a username/password to login and get a Bearer token:

```
bundle exec ruby exe/floe --workflow my-workflow.asl --credentials='{"username": "user", "password": "pass"}'
```

```json
{
  "StartAt": "Login",
  "States": {
    "Login": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "docker://login:latest",
      "Credentials": {
        "username.$": "$.username",
        "password.$": "$.password"
      },
      "ResultPath": "$$.Credentials",
      "Next": "DoSomething"
    },
    "DoSomething": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "docker://do-something:latest",
      "Credentials": {
        "token.$": "$$.Credentials.bearer_token"
      },
      "End": true
    }
  }
}
```

### Ruby Library

```ruby
require 'floe'

workflow = Floe::Workflow.load("workflow.asl")
workflow.run!
```

You can also specify a specific docker runner and runner options:
```ruby
require 'floe'

Floe::Workflow::Runner.docker_runner = Floe::Workflow::Runner::Podman.new
# Or
Floe::Workflow::Runner.docker_runner = Floe::Workflow::Runner::Kubernetes.new("namespace" => "default", "server" => "https://k8s.example.com:6443", "token" => "my-token")

workflow = Floe::Workflow.load("workflow.asl")
workflow.run!
```

### Non-Blocking Workflow Execution

It is also possible to step through a workflow without blocking, and any state which
would block will return `Errno::EAGAIN`.

```ruby
require 'floe'

workflow = Floe::Workflow.load("workflow.asl")

# Step through the workflow while it would not block
workflow.run_nonblock

# Go off and do some other task

# Continue stepping until the workflow is finished
workflow.run_nonblock
```

You can also use the `Floe::Workflow.wait` class method to wait on multiple workflows
and return all that are ready to be stepped through.

```ruby
require 'floe'

workflow1 = Floe::Workflow.load("workflow1.asl")
workflow2 = Floe::Workflow.load("workflow2.asl")

running_workflows = [workflow1, workflow2]
until running_workflows.empty?
  # Wait for any of the running workflows to be ready (up to the timeout)
  ready_workflows = Floe::Workflow.wait(running_workflows)
  # Step through the ready workflows until they would block
  ready_workflows.each do |workflow|
    workflow.run_nonblock
  end
  # Remove any finished workflows from the list of running_workflows
  running_workflows.reject!(&:end?)
end
```

### Task Runners

Floe provides a number of options for the Task `"Resource"` parameter.  The `"Resource"` runner is declared by the author based on the `URI`.

Task Runner Types:
* `floe://`
* `docker://`

#### Floe resource

This is the "builtin" runner and exposes methods that are executed internally without having to call out to a docker image.

##### HTTP builtin method

`floe://http` allows you to execute HTTP method calls.

Example:
```json
{
  "Comment": "Execute a HTTP call",
  "StartAt": "HTTP",
  "States": {
    "HTTP": {
      "Type": "Task",
      "Resource": "floe://http",
      "Parameters": {
        "Method": "POST",
        "Url": "http://localhost:3000/api/login",
        "Headers": {"ContentType": "application/json"},
        "Body": {"username.$": "$$.Credentials.username", "password.$": "$$.Credentials.password"},
        "Options": {"Encoding": "JSON"}
      },
      "ResultSelector": {"auth_token.$": "$.Body.auth_token"},
      "ResultPath": "$$.Credentials",
      "End": true
    }
```

HTTP Parameters:
* `Method` (required) - HTTP method name. Permitted values: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `HEAD`, `PATCH`, `OPTIONS`, or `TRACE`.  Defaults to `GET`.
* `Url` (required) - URL to execute the HTTP call to

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and the created tag, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
